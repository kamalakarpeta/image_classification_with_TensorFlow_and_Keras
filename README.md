# Introduction

This Jupyter Notebook provides a simple example of using the MNIST dataset for training and evaluating a basic neural network model. The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 small images of handwritten digits labeled with their corresponding digit.

The script is divided into five sections: importing the necessary libraries, loading the data, preprocessing the data, building and training the model, and evaluating the model.

## Dependencies

The following libraries are required for running the code:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Matplotlib

You can install the libraries using pip:

pip install tensorflow keras matplotlib
## GitHub Repository

## Conclusion

In summary, this Jupyter Notebook provides a basic pipeline for training and evaluating a neural network model using the MNIST dataset. It covers the steps of loading the data, preprocessing the data, building the model, training the model, and evaluating the model's accuracy.

By following this example, you can gain a better understanding of working with image datasets, preprocessing data, building neural network models, and evaluating model performance. The code trains a basic neural network model on the MNIST dataset for 5 epochs. The model architecture includes a Flatten layer, followed by two Dense layers. The model is compiled with the 'adam' optimizer and 'SparseCategoricalCrossentropy' loss function. Accuracy is used as the evaluation metric.

The notebook also includes an example of visualizing the first 5 images in the test dataset using Matplotlib. This visualization helps in understanding the data and verifying the model's predictions.

In conclusion, this notebook serves as a starting point for working with image classification tasks using neural networks and the MNIST dataset. It provides opportunities for further exploration and experimentation with different architectures, optimization algorithms, and hyperparameters to improve model accuracy. The accompanying GitHub repository contains the code and additional resources for reference and customization.

By building upon this foundation, you can expand your knowledge in deep learning and computer vision, and apply these techniques to more complex tasks and datasets.
